pyshapefile is a set of classes that can be used to read ESRI shapefiles. The initial development was funded by <a href="http://nicholas.demonchaux.com">Nicholas de Monchaux</a>, as part of the Local Code project, an urban design research project conducted at the University of California Berkeley Department of Architecture.

The classes were extended from the <a href="http://indiemaps.com/blog/2008/03/easy-shapefile-loading-in-python/">shpUtils library written by Zachary Forest Johnson</a>, and are similarly dependent on the dbfUtils module by <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/users/178123/">Raymond Hettinger</a>.
