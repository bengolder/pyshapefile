# pyshapefile

-----------

**pyshapefile** is a set of python classes that can be used to read ESRI shapefiles. The development was conducted with (and funded by) [Nicholas de Monchaux](www.nicholas.demonchaux.com),  as part of the Local Code project, an urban design research project conducted at the University of California Berkeley. This work is shared under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The classes use portions of the shpUtils module written by [Zachary Forest Johnson](www.indiemaps.com), and are similarly dependent on the dbfUtils module by [Raymond Hettinger](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/362715-dbf-reader-and-writer/). 

The project is still in progress, and some functions are merely empty placeholders for future additions. Also, it's my first significant attempt at writing a set of classes in python (or writing any code for that matter), so criticism and comments on how it can be improved are welcomed.

Thanks for checking it out.
